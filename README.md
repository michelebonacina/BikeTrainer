## aBikeTrainer - Arduino Bike Trainer
If you have got an old cycle computer, even broken, probably the cadence and wheel sensor can be reused for building a more powerful cycle trainer, which helps you during your indoor training session.
The sensor gets pedals and wheel movements while an Arduino board do the rest.
